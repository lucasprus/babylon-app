## Disclaimer

This application is demo only. Just as much as I could deliver in such a short time. There's a number of improvements that could be added to make it look closer to a commercial project.

I din't have time to add unit tests or e2e tests. If it's a part of a task I can add those later. Take a look at these from my another project if you want to see some samples: https://github.com/lucasprus/lp-toggle/tree/master/test/spec

Please reach me at lucas.prus@gmail.com or Skype: "lukasz.prus." if and I'll be happy to explain anything or show it running locally.
